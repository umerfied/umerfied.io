                    <h2>Letter 1</h2>
                    <p>My Love Samra,I just want to confess my love for u. and it not something unusual but quite the opposite. You have a space in my heart. what i meant is that a physical space in my heart belongs to U. no matter what happens that space will always be yours. And that space contain a lot of memories and future that I have planned with U. I cherish my every second that i have spent with Your soul. Those moments when i get lost in your eyes. or be distracted by the fact that U have such a gorgeous smile. My Heart finds solace in your gentle gaze, whenever i come to pick U up and I see you walking towards me. My mind goes into a disbelief k How can someone that cute Love me. What have i done in my life that i deserve her. Her presence itself i worth all the appreciation. 
                        I think it was yesterday when U sent a picture of yourself. and i entered the room and saw my mom watching that snap for a long time and smiling. She was happy for me.ü•∫ Its very rare to watch my mom smile genuinely.</p>

                    <h2>Letter 2</h2>
                    <p>Your kindness and warmth light up my life. You are truly one of a kind.It takes only 21 days to leave a habit. and its been 8 Months and I'm still in Love and counting. I used to read soo much about how to break habits Cz i couldn't break my bad habits. And all it took a text from U to break that. If possible, I would have taken all of your sufferings and put those in myself. If possible, I would have taken all of your pain and transfer that in myself, so U couldn't feel that. If possible, I would have taken all of your bad luck and misery and transfer that in myself, and still be the happiest person alive. If possible, I would have transfer all of your weakness into myself. Only to see U happy even still i would be the happiest man alive. You are my journey, My beginning, my End. I have to reach U with everything i have got. You are always and forever where I want to be.</p>

                    <h2>Letter 3</h2>
                    <p>Wishing you all the happiness in the world, today and every day!. I wanna sacrifice everything for U. I don't know what the barrier is but I wanna cross Everything. When i say that i wanna merge our souls i mean it in a way that I wanna know your everything. The things U like and dislike. also the things that pisses U off. I know that there is a long way ahead of me. But I will give my all in knowing U fully. I just understand the summary and the short part of most of the things. I just learn the part where it benefits only me. But when it comes to U. I wanna know each and every little detail about U. I replay our moments together in my head. Like the one when U were getting your nose piercing. That moment was like finding the sunlight in a rainy day. I do wish that I could shower U with good news. I Wish to see U happy and blessed. Happy Birthday Samra. And I Love Uüíñ‚òÄÔ∏è</p>
